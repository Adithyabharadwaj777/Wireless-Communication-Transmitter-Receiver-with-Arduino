# Arduino Communication: Transmitter and Receiver Project

This project demonstrates serial communication between two Arduino UNO boards (ARD1 and ARD2). It uses a transmitter module (push button interface) and a receiver module (relay and lamp control system) to turn on/off electrical loads.

##  Components Used

- 2 Ã— Arduino UNO
- 2 Ã— Push Buttons
- 2 Ã— Resistors (330Î©)
- 2 Ã— NPN Transistors (BC547)
- 2 Ã— Relays (12V)
- 2 Ã— Diodes (1N4007)
- 2 Ã— Lamps (12V)
- Jumper Wires
- External 12V Power Supply
- Breadboard or PCB (optional)

##  Working Principle

- **ARD1 (Transmitter):**
  - Reads button inputs.
  - Sends a signal via Serial Tx to ARD2 when buttons are pressed.

- **ARD2 (Receiver):**
  - Receives serial data.
  - Depending on input, it activates transistors and relays.
  - The relays turn on/off the connected lamps.
